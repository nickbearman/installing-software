## Signing up to Element/Matrix

I use Matrix as a discussion room for many of my courses, as an open source alternative to Slack. Follow the instructions to sign up to the public Matrix room for [FOSS4G:UK Local 2022](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/). If you want to find out more about Matrix and Element, check out [this blog post](https://www.geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk/matrix-whats-it-all-about/). 

- Click on the link [https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org)

- Click **Continue**.

- Click **Continue** again under Element. *There are many different chat clients, but I think Element is easiest to setup.*

- Choose **Continue in your browser**. 

- Click **Sign Up**.  

- Register for an account on Matrix.org, either signup for an account, or login with GitHub, Google, GitLab, Facebook, or Apple.  

- Complete the "I'm not a robot" captcha field, agree to the Terms and Conditions and click **Accept**.  

- Verify your address by clicking the link in the the email - **Verify Your Email Address**.   

- This will open a web page saying Registration Successful and *should* log you in to your account.  

- You might get a message `#OSGeoUK:matrix.org can't be previewed. Do you want to join it?`. This is fine. 

- Click **Join the discussion** to join the room.  

- If you can't find the room, click the link [https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org). 

You are good to go!
