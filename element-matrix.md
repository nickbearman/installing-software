## Signing up to Element/Matrix

For most of my courses I run a discussion channel, available before, during and after the course. Here we will sign up to use a program called Element (which runs in a web browser) to access the discussion channel on Matrix. If you want to find out more about Matrix and Element, check out [this blog post](https://www.geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk/matrix-whats-it-all-about/). 

- I will have emailed you an invite link that looks a bit like this:

- Click **Join the conversation.** to get started

- Click **Sign Up**

- Register for an account on Matrix.org, either signup for an account, or login with GitHub, Google, Facebook, or Apple.

- Verify your address by clicking the link in the the email. 

- If you can't find the room, click the **Join the conversation.** link in the invite email again. 

- You might also need to click 'Join Discussion' to join the room. 

You are good to go!
