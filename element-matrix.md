## Signing up to Element/Matrix

For most of my courses I run a discussion room on Matrix, available before, during and after the course. Here we will sign up to use a program called Element (which runs in a web browser) to access the discussion channel on Matrix. If you want to find out more about Matrix and Element, check out [this blog post](https://www.geospatialtrainingsolutions.co.uk/matrix-whats-it-all-about/). 

Instructions are below, and I have also created a video at [https://youtu.be/HU3mKxbH-zc](https://youtu.be/HU3mKxbH-zc). 

- I will have emailed you an invite link that looks a bit like this:

- Click **Join the conversation.** to get started. This will open a web page.  

- Click **Sign Up**.  

- Register for an account on Matrix.org, either signup for an account, or login with GitHub, Google, GitLab, Facebook, or Apple.  

- Complete the "I'm not a robot" captcha field, agree to the Terms and Conditions and click **Accept**.  

- Verify your address by clicking the link in the the email - **Verify Your Email Address**.   

- This will open a web page saying Registration Successful.  

- Then login with your new account.  

- Click **Join Discussion** to join the room.  

- If you can't find the room, click the **Join the conversation** link in the invite email again. 

You are good to go!
